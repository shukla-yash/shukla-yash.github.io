**Research Interests**

My research interests can broadly be categorized as follows:

- **Foundational Models (LLMs / VLMs):** Leveraging LLMs / VLMs to improve sample efficiency of RL agents _and_ embodied robotic agents.

- **Neurosymbolic AI:** Using temporal logical specifications and planning domains to improve learning progress of RL agents. 

- **Curriculum Learning for RL:** Coming up with efficient representations to break down complex RL task into simpler sequenatial and graphical task representations that improve the learning progress of RL agents.

- **CV and Robotics:** Understanding and analyzing human intent using CV (Images, Videos, Depth) and natural language for efficient human-robot collaboration.

- **Sim2Real Transfer:** Transferring RL policies from Simulated environments to Physical robotic settings

Most applications of my work are directed toward Robotics and Robot Learning.
