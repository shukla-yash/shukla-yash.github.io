I am a Second Year Graduate Student pursuing Masters in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA. I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. My research interests include dexterous robot manipulation, robot grasping, 3-D pose estimation of objects, active vision and robot vision.

I am seeking a Research Assistantship/Ph.D. in Robotics with applications in robot manipulation, artificial intelligence and robot vision.

I enjoy summiting peaks, traveling, and watching movies.
