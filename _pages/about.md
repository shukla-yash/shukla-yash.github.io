**Research Interests**

- Neurosymbolic AI, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Foundational Models (LLMs, VLMs)

Current Reinforcement Learning techniques aimed towards achieving autonomy rely heavily on availability of large sample size, which is unrealistic in most settings. To tackle these problems, I intend to abstract symbolic information (obtained from Linear Temporal Logic, Large Language Models, Planning domain languages, etc.) and utilize it to enhance the learning progress of the RL agent. 

Most applications of my work are directed toward Robotics and Robot Learning.
