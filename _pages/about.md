## Research Interests


- Neurosymbolic AI, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision

Current RL techniques aimed towards achieving autonomy rely heavily on availability of large sample size, which is unrealistic in most settings. To tackle these problems, I intend to combine symbolic information as efficiently as possible to aid learning in artifical agents.
