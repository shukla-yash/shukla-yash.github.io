  * Designing and applying DDPG to a 4 DOF manipulator to achieve motion planning faster than RRT.
  * Adding expert demonstrations in the DDPG implementation to achieve faster convergence.
  * Comparing and evaluating Imitation Learning, Supervised Learning and DDPG-MP approaches for motion planning.

* Viewpoint optimization for aiding grasp synthesis algorithms using supervised learning, WPI (Jan '19 - Present)
  * Implemented active vision methodology to optimize depth sensor viewpoint to increase synthesized grasp quality.
  * Employed supervised learning techniques to obtain viewpoint optimized policy by generating automated training data.
  * Simulated results using Gazebo. Currently implementing the algorithms on Franka Emika Panda Robot.
  
* Ship Detection and Segmentation from Aerial Images, WPI (Aug '18 - Dec '18)
  * Implemented a two model Deep Learning architecture to segment ships from aerial images on Airbus Dataset.
